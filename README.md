# Pattern Recognition (2019-2020)

## Aims:
This course aims to introduce the concepts, basic formulations and applications of pattern recognition. 

The module studies, given feature representation in a vector form, the concept of machine perception and decision surfaces, and metrics/distances, model fitting, as basic tools to process and classify data.
Deep Convolutional Neural Network is taught as the-state-of-the-art PR method.

The learnt topics are illustrated with few applications: face recognition, or machine learning repository data, etc.

Python or Matlab Tutorial

### Learning Outcomes:
The study of pattern recognition at this level develops a set of skills and knowledge about theories and practice in recognising regularities in signal and data. By the end of the module the students should be able to
• Explain the concepts and theory of statistical pattern representation, detection, and matching;
• Discuss examples of pattern recognition solutions in various application areas.
• Explain the functioning and properties of main pattern recognition techniques.
• Identify appropriate solutions to typical pattern recognition problems.
